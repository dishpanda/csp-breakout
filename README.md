# csp-breakout
The breakout project I did in AP CS P last year, using the CodeHS API.
#Disclaimer
I do not condone cheating in any way, shape or form. Learn how the code works, and you will do much better in the field, and in the class. 
By understanding the code, you will have a deeper appreciation for the language as well as the API. This is really deep now, but it's important you stay academically honest. 
*you will perish otherwise*
